# Ycombinator Hackernews reader

This is my part time project. Objective is to create my perfect hackernews reading client.

### Goals
- [ ] Minimal simple interface. Must look pretty and clean. Current design is driving me crazy
- [ ] Better way to handle discussions on website. (Comments notifications, stuff like that)
- [ ] Ability to bookmark news
- [ ] Maybe share them on facebook or smth.

### Contributions
Let's make this thing ^_^ university lectures are boring anyway :wink:
